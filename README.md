# SPEEDER

After reading [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/nyregion/new-york-subway-delay.html) I was curious how fast the 7 train I sometimes take really was going. Seeing no apps to simply show speed and location in the app store, I quickly threw one together.

Holding down on the screen shows coordinates as well as altitude information.

To-Do:
- [ ] Read km/h or mp/h from user's locale
